Underlying code for Rage Against the Machine: How Inequality Affected Technological Progress in Nineteenth-Century Prussia

The abstract of the paper is:

This dissertation examines the relationship between land inequality and the Industrial Revolution in nineteenth-century Prussia. An instrumental variable approach, using the heterogeneity in soil quality, suggests that there is a causal negative impact of land inequality on the spread of the Industrial Revolution as measured by the occupational structure. This impact is not detectable when examining investments in new technologies or methods of textile production.
